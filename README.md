# MultidimSynapticProteins

This repository contains all scripts that were used to generate the results in the paper : _Activity-dependent remodelling of synaptic protein organization revealed by high throughput analysis of STED nanoscopy images_.

To facilitate the usage of the `MultidimSynapticProteins` we provide the user with a `Jupyter Notebook`. We recommend a new user following the steps in at this [link](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html) to run the provided notebook. The notebook, scripts and data used are all provided in the `/src` folder.

# Required packages 

To facilitate the installation of the packages we creates a `requirements.txt` file containing all necessary packages. The users can validate that they have all required packages using this command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

# Run example data

We provide to the user a small amount of data to run the notebook from its own computer.
