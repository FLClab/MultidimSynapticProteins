# MultidimSynapticProteins

This repository contains all scripts that were used to generate the results in the paper : _Activity-dependent remodelling of synaptic protein organization revealed by high throughput analysis of STED nanoscopy images_.

To facilitate the usage of the `MultidimSynapticProteins` we provide the user with a __Jupyter Notebook__. We recommend new users to follow the steps at this [link](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html) to run the provided notebook. Users familiar with a __Jupyter Notebook__ can verify the [required packages](#required-packages) and jump to the [run example data](#run-example) section. The notebook, scripts and data used are all provided in the `/src` folder.

# Required packages 

To facilitate the installation of the packages we creates a `requirements.txt` file containing all necessary packages. The users can validate that they have all required packages using this command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

<a id="run-example"></a>
# Run example data

We provide to the user a small amount of data to run the notebook from its own computer. To launch the __Jupyter Notebook__ the users should enter the following command
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

In the _Define constants_ section of the __Jupyter Notebook__ users can modify the parameters of the analysis pipeline. The other sections are self-explanatory and well commented to allow the users to follow the analysis.
